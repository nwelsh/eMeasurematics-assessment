Assessment steps 
1) Learn Raycasting https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Raycaster
2) Very small react project using three.js
3) Left side, canvas. Right side, react panel
4) In the canvas, 2 small 3d cubes, nothing else needed but space them out some.
5) React panel with space to put information into.
6) With the raycaster, clicking on each cube should give you mesh data and each mesh should have a UUID or some other three.js identification that you can then place into the react panel, statefully.
Bonus, recolor the cubes.
Bonus++ let me select a color to change a cube to.
